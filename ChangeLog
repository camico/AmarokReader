 b: set a timeout of 10 seconds for search requests
 b: avoid temp files to be written to home directory when KDE session is quit with Amarok still running
 a: quick fix to make it work (at least not exit) with last.fm streams (you can't have more than one review at a time yet)

history:
   status icon (should be in track infobox but thats too theme-dependent)
   more javascript niftyness
   now always use an iframe by default, and wrap ascii files in html
   introduce javascript scrolling. away with those ugly scrollbars.
   use a "pre" for ascii files, and an iframe for html
   always show text in a "pre" block, and for html files, strip the tags

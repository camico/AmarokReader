Name=Amarok Reader
Comment=Displays text or html files found in the playing directory and (optionally) web reviews for the currently playing album.\n\nUsage: The icon in the upper left corner will open the review search menu. Here you can click a site name to start a single search, select sites for auto-search on album change, or manually start a search on all sites. Found reviews are stored in the playing directory. The menu includes two buttons for opening the current file externally and for moving it to trash.\n\nNavigation: Use the left/right buttons or mouse wheel on the header bar to switch between multiple files. Hover over the up/down arrows to scroll comfortably. Left-click to speed up. Right-click to jump a page up/down. Click the little bar to jump to top/bottom.\n\nIn the Settings menu, you can turn off that the window automatically opens along with Amarok. If you use kwin as a window manager (KDE default), you can easily make the window remember its size and position: Right-click title bar > More Actions > Special Window Settings...\n\nSystem requirements: Amarok >= 2.6, Python 2.x, Linux. Other OS's are untested but might work; Amarok 2.5 does NOT work. If you have .nfo files with ascii art, consider installing the font Lucida ConsoleP.
